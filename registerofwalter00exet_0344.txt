3'02 THE REGIS'PER or BISHOP STAPELDON.

Wrms, Wmanm, in his Chapel of Landren, in the Parish of Northill, Cornwall3
once ayear on 15 Aug, the Feast of the Assumption, (19 Feb„ 1311-12); 69.—
The Manor of Landreyne is said, in a MS. volume, drawn up by the lass:
male heir of the Spoure Family‚ and containing an account os thal: Family
and their possessions, to have belonged to William, Lord Wallis, who was
attainted in the Reign of Edward 111„ and had a daughter Christian married
to John Trebartha. We can find no account of this Lord Wallis in any other
Heraldie Books, either printed or MS. ; it is certain that the Mauors of Land-
reyne and Northill belonged to the Com-tenays, Earls of Devon, and, having
been forfeited by attainder, were annexesl to the Duchy of Cornwall (Lysons).
He is nob called “ Lord,'' here, in the Register, and it is possible that the last
of the Spoures may have confused him, by reason of the similarity of name
with Richard Waleys, a Baron by writ, who was summoned to Parliament ai:
about this time, viz„ 15 May, 14 Edw. ΙΙ (1321), but never afterwards. Sec
Sir Harris Nicolas‘ Historia Peerayc: he points out that “Dugdale gives no
account of this Baton in his Baronaye: he ωδε, however, of the Party of
Thomas, Earl of Laneaster, was present ab the Battle of Bwoughbridge, and
received Writs 011 various occasions between 1308 and 13253 although never
summoned to Parlianu-nt :after 1:321. He lest a son, Stephen Waleys, living
1348, whose only dau. and h.‚ ΕΠΖ-(1116111, was the wife of Sir John Depedene,
