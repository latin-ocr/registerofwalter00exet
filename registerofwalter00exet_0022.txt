Michael,- another vexatious delay, which he had begged hard to be
spared, but without effect. His position was ει most painful one:
for, by this time, he was reduced to such straits that he was even
compelled to ask 1115 Brother-Eleet 10 pay their joint expensos, making¹
provision de esculentis et poculentis for both of them ς aud he engaged
to settle his share of 1110 account later on. They were consecrated*

reach of London. While 110 was at Urediton he held 1115 first

country town must have presented on 11115 notable occasion.2

Document preserved in Bishop Brantingham’s Register (vol. ii, fol. 36) shews that it
must have taken place shortly before the 2211d of December. See Oliver's Morzastieon,
