PREFACE. xxxiii

(01· a portion of the value) was ‘⁴ iis.⁷’ I was wrong, and my mistake
made it hard to 1000101· the preceding words. Mr. Baigent (apart
from the MS), read my printed proof, in 11111011 (being still uneertain
about it), I had not included the supposed priee. There was nothing
before him, therefore, but a row of dots ς nothing to misle-ad him: and,
with his usual sagacity, he came to the eonelusion that the missing
words were, probably “ sepultus est.³' ι4111ιί10 it,⁷⁷ he wrote, “that this

Ι substituted for my row of dots the sueoested words, within braekets;
and the sheet was printed. Subsequently, desii-ing to follow up this

And, 11010, l inay be permitted to say that only those who haye been
aeeustomed to attempt this sort of work (11111011 is, often, abandoned,
at the outset, in despair), have any idea os its difficulty. A strong
light is necessary, and a powerful magnifici* 2 and when the eyes are
weary the task must be dropped for a time, and returned to 0101· and
over again. The 111111111011111· hopeless spot must be heldat every possible
angle ; and, at length, a werd (or, it may be, only a letter), suddenly
appears out of the obseui‘ity. ()n this occasion ‘the last word was the
first to yield itself to my gaze. lt was “sepultus '⁷1 There was 110

enough for four letters, but exaetly enough for two, and presently
the letter ³ x '’ revealed itself to me. A moment more and the blot
which preceded it was seen to be a capital ‘² E.'' The word, then,
was “ Exonie.’y The first word was not merely hidden by the brown
Veil—the smear of galL—but broken up by rough usage. lt was,
