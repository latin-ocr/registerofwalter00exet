xxvi PREFACE.

grave importance ς and that, even 11 the sentence were wrong and
unjust, it was expedient that great care should be taken to avoid
doing greater injustice and injury by revoking it hurriedly. The
Bishop was loyal to his King: but especially loyal in this, that he
would save 111111, 11 110 could, from the onl)v too probable consequenees
01 an act which he believed to be both rash and full of peril. Akis,
we know that his forebodings were fully justified. But, at an)v rate,
the course which he recommended was adopted. A Parliament was
held at York, about three weeks after Easter, 1322, and St-apeldon
went up from Exeter 10 attend it, starting on the 12th or 13111 01
April, and resting at Bytton, in Gloucesteislm-e, on his way. In this
Parliament the Statute of Indemnity, which had been passed 111
1321, in relief of those who had broken the King's peace by
“pursuing and (1051101100- ’' 1110 I)espeiise1·S‚ was repealed⁷ and
their exile was annulled.

The Bishop's stay in York extended over more than three months.
On the 23rd 01 June the King granted him Licenee ‘co crenellate his
Palace at Exeter,¹ and early in August he paid a hurried risit 10 his
Cathedral City, but only to return 10 York immediately: and there
we find him (or at Aeomb, a platee close at hand), 1111 just before the
16111 01 December, on which day he passed through Pcterbormigh2
0111115 wayto London. ἢ* 1110 26111 01 Januzir)v he was at Clyst
again; and he remained in Devonsliire till the middle of March,
dedicating the Chureh of ngorough 011 the. illst of February, and
reconciling· the Church and Cemetery 01 Demi-Prior 011 the following
day. As usual he devoted several days to his great work at ExeterJ
and this was his last 11511, of an)v durution⁷ to his Diocese. The
Entries in his Register for l323 seem 10 shew that during the
wholc 01 that year he was unable 10 sparo a day, even for the
(jathedral. He was at Bristol on 1110 29111 of 31111011,- and by 1110
15111 of April we find him, once more, at York, where hc remained
till about the middle 01 July. On the 6111 01 August he was
appointed Constable of the Towerf On ‘the 7111110 was at Oseney
