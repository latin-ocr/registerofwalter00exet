xxviii PREFACE.

his Dean and Chapter on the 9th 01 August, complaining of “the
neglected state of several of the. parochi-al (thure-hes, exhorting them
to look to their substantia] rcpair, and especially calling on the
Dean, as holding Archidiaconal Jurisdictiou 111 the Peeuliars 01 the.
Chapter, to enforce obedience to this Episcopal Ordinanco.²⁷¹ The
Choir of the Cathedral was, practically, finishe(l; and our Bishop
vigorously continued his preparations for the immediato commence-
ment of tho stupendous work 01 rebuilding¹ (or, 115 we know from
recent discoveries, recasting, in part at least), the Norman Nave. We
find him investing larger in bnilding gear 111111 materials. Fifteen
great popla1·-trees were bought for seaffolding and a hundred alder-
trees, besides much timber from Torre Abbev, Norton, and Sidbun‘,
as well as from London (his own purchase 011 the spot), and much
stone from Beer, Burlescombe, and SaleomboRegis. And, instead of
merely continuing his customary⁷ annual erist of 2124, he started the
new enterprise bv a princelv donation of LOOO marks—AEGGG 133. 411,
about θ1316,ΟΟΟ 01 our money, ‘⁴ de dono Venerabilis Domini Walteri
Episcopi dicto operi.¹'

He left the Diocese. 011 the 23111 01 September (having first visited
Ottory and Newenham 11111101), and proceeded, hy way 01 Lodres
l‘riory, to London. He knew it notg but his episcopal work was
over, and the last two years of liis 1110 were destined to be spent 111
the immediate service 01 1115 King and (nuntry. And yet there is
evidence to shcw that, at 11 most critical time, little more than three
weeks before his death, he contrived to pav a. flving visit to Exeter ;
so near his heart was the noble Sanctuary to which he had devoted
so much loving care 111111 so large a portion 01 1115 worldlv substance.
On the 221111 01 September, 1326, he appeared, for the last time, in
the Chapter-House, and there confirmed 1111 Agreement between the
Chapter and the Nuus 01 Polslo. In all probability he was returning
from Cornwall⁷ the Custody 01 the Castle 01 Tintagel having been
committed to him two months before.²
