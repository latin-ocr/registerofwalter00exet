XXX PREFACE.

translated by Leland (Collectanea, i, 467), gives a somewhat different

acfioIlssl'ltlge yere 1326, [Isabel], Edwarde, Edmund of lVodestock, Earl of Kent,

and ,101111 ot* Henaud arrived at Harwiche. After the landding of them, King
Edu-arde heard that the Londoners were miuded to rendre them self to them.
Whereupon he sent Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Exeestre, his T1·esorer,¹ for to be
Gardiane of the Cyte with the Mziyie3 and he, commyng to the Guildhaulle,
desired, according to his Commission, the keyes aud custody ot the Cyte. To
whom the Commoris answered that they wolde kepe the Towne for the King, the
Quene, aud his Sunne. And the Bishop not content with this answer, they toke
him and smit of his hedde, in the middle of Westchepe, and, after, beheddid 2
Esquires that waytid on him. Wylliam Waulle, his nephew, was the oue, aud
John Padington the other. And, after, they beheddid a Burges, one John
Mai-eschai, Espy yn London for the Dispensars. At this tyme Walter Stapleton
was making a faire toni-e 011 the very Tamys side, at this place, withoute Temple
Bar, and, lakking stone and lyme to 11111511 it, sent a force to the Chirch of the
thite Freres (Freres de la Pie), and toke it, and yn despite of this the Loundeuer
biryid stapleton and his 2 Esquires in the hepe of rubrische aboute his Toure. as
they had been dogges. And no mex-vel. For he was fumisohe and without pite.
Eut after xj weeks, at the requeste of Quene Isabel's lettres, the Bishops body
was caried to the Chireh thereby. and after to Exeestre. And the 2 Esquires
bodyes were caryed to S. Clementes Chiroh, and there buried.”

The animus of the writer of all this is only too ma11ifest3 ancl, as

Mr. Boase justly remarks, “it must be remembered that the account
comes from the Bishop's enemios.'' The niunificent and sels-sacrificing
benefactor of his Cathedral Church, the friend und bountiful patron
of “poor 5011011115,”2 who, as the Account of his Executors shows,
remembered them loringly and tenderly to the very last, nientioning a
large number of them by name in his Will, was not the unm to rob
u. Church in order to obtain materials for a new house for himself!
More truthful, obviously, because more consistent with what we know
of the Bishop’s character and of the special dangers and difficulties
with which it was his lot to contend, is the following account, given
by Walsingham in 1115 Historia Auylicmza (Ed. Riky, i, 182), and
derived from an earlier compilation made at St. Albans towards the

close of the l4th Cenum-5,—
