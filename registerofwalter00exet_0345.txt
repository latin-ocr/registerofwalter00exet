[Oxford3 Exeter College (olim “Stapoldonc Halle⁷')‚ the
Statutes of,—

[Owing to the evils connected with the system of Students, lodging all over
the City of Oxford, Statesmen like Walter de Morton in Henry the Third's
time, and Walter de Stapeldou under Edwurd the Second, founded
“Colleges,'' that the Students might live together, under a Rector, to
maintain discipline and order. Their object was to establish u constant
succession of poor and diligent Students, and train them for the service of
God in Church and State. These Colleges were, by no means, mainly
Clerical Institutione. Stapeldon provides for thirteen Scholars (i.e.
Fellows), twelve of them studying Philosophy, while the thirteenth was to
be a Priest, studying Thoology and Canon-Law. Tenpence a week was
allowed them for their commons ς and, besides this, the Rector had twenty
shillings a year; the Priest, also, twenty shflli11gs; and each Scholar ten
shillings. The Fellowship ended three years after the Fellow had taken
the Degree of Master of Arts ς so that men might be passed 111 considerable
numbers through the University training, and then sent out into the world.
Thus the Fellows were, themselves, all [index-going the process of training 3
and they were not Fellows ns at present, for there were no other Under-
graduatcs in the College.

The modern Statutes have, in some degi-ce, reverted to Stapeldon's plan. For
there are twelve Fellowships‚ including the Chaplain, and about twenty-
six Scholarships and twelve Exhibitions ; so that a considerable part of the
funde is devoted to traiuing men aud passing them out into active life, as
Stapeldon wished. The Statutes of the early Founders are well worth
