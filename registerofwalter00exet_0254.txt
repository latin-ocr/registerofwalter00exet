212 THE REGISTER oF BISHOP STAPELDON.

commendam, Master Richard de Coletone, priest, Canon of Exeter, in the
presence of Master John de Linham, Canon of St. David's, Sir Peter (le Hone-
tone, and Robert de Tantone, chaplains, and Richard de Twyvertone—“ ui hec
scripsit.” The Letters refer to the fact that the said Archdeaconry 111 the huroh
of Exeter “non Dignitas set Personatus esse dieitur in eadem,“ and had been
for a long time the subject of a suit in the Court of Rome, which was stin
pending (to say nothing of other reasons for the vacaucy), to the Bishop's great
grief (16 Aug„ 1317) ; 120¹). On the 21st, the Bishop wrote to the Dean, directing
him to induet Coletone, Η1101111110, tamen, Commende.'' And he wrote to the
Chancellor, Walter Giffard, on the same day, informing him that the Letters of
Commendation were to be transferred to himself, if Coletone should refuse
Induction3 121. N either Le Neve nor Οῖίιέν notice this appointment.
As the Bishop, evidently, anticipated, Coletoue made a difficulty. The Letters
were sent to him in due course, and he, being at Crediton, on the 26th of
August, “ personaliter in porticu Aule Domini ibidem asseruit se iu recepcione
dictarum Literarum protestatum fuisse nolle redditus nec proventus dicti Arch-
idiaconatus recipere, nec, finita Commenda hujusmodi vel ante, occasione
ejusdem, se velle ad raciocinia reddenda aliqualiter obligari : quodque, si
occasione dicte Commende fatigatus fuisset iu laboribus et expensis, se velle [le
redditibus, fructibus, et proventibus, aut alias, a prefato Domino expensas pro
sua defensione habere et exigere cum effectu. Et nichilominus idern Magister
Ricardus, die et loco predictis, similiter protestabatur ; eligendo tamen Dominum
Walterum Daumarle, Receptorem ipsius Domini apud Exoniam, pro Receptore
et Depositario reddituum, fructuum, et proventuum dieti Amhidiaconatus, qui
vice ipsius Magistri Ricardi de eisdem responderet cum esset requisitus.
Praesentibus Magistro Nicholao cle Hele, Galfrido de Tottonia, clericis, Ricardo
de Twyvertone, Notario Publice, et J ohanne de Brittestowe ’⁷ ; 121. On the 2ud
of Feb„ 1317-18, the Bishop revoked Coletone’s Collation, and collated

Master Thomas Hereward, was collated 11 June &videlicet Die Dominica in

SUB-Dems—

informs us that he was “collated by Bp. Stapeldon, 26 July‚ 1313 ’ ¹——a ειη-10115
mistake ; for (as Oliver rightly states), ‘⁴ Bp. Stapeldon confirmed to him the
Appropria‘cion of Egloshayle‚” on that day. The date of his Collation is
lost, but he was Sub-Dean as early as June, 1301 ; see p. 153. On his
