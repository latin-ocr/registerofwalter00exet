and, in fact, there was a dispute between the King and the Bishop as to thc.
right to present. Both Oliver and Le Neve state that (during this interval, viz),
22 -Ian.‚ 1308-9, Royer de Otery “was appointeffl to the Dignity; but thoy
give no authority for this statement, and there is no Entry to that effect in the
Register ; to which, however, they refer for his actual Collatiam seven months
later—viz„ 23 Aug. (and, again, without prejudice to the King); 43. The
matter was, however, not yet finally settled ; for, 22 J an., 1309-10‚ we find the
Bishop appointing Otery to the Cliancellorship (in his absence) in. commendam,
and writing to him thus,--“Licet nuper Cancellariam Ecclesie Exoniensis

January, the Bishop directed his Mandate to the Sub-Dean for Otery’s Induct-
