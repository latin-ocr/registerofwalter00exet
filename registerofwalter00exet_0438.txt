Being too ill to attend to his· duties a Commission was directed (4 Feb„ 1316-17),
to two of the Canons, Rd. de 1101663116, Arehdn. of Earum, and Benedici: de
Pastone, empowering 1116111 to act in his stead ; 117.-In March or April

were appointed his coadjutors. [The date is omitted, the words “ Datum apud '¹
being followed by a blank space. In the margin has been written ‘¹ Inquiratur
quo'']⁴ The Bishop, while absent froin his Diocese, had been grieved to hear
that no small claniour had arisen on atscount of the Subdean’s condition ; he was
very ill, suffering from loss of meniory and other afflictions, aud he, evidently,
despaired os recovery and was wasting 1116 goods of the Churoh. The Bishop
felt it his duty to come home and 366 to the matter in person. He had met the
Dean and Chapter, the Subdean being present ; and the reports turned out to be
true. Uphavene could not manage even 1113 own affairs ; 111111 1116 Bishop, having
forbidden him to deal with the gomis of the Church in any way, appointed as
eoadjutors the two Vicars alnox-enaiued, because of the well-known regard which
Uphavene had always entertained for them while he was compos mentis. They
were to act, at first, in concert with one or more of the Canem, to be deputed for
‘that purpose by the Chapter ; making an Inventory of the Suhdean's effects, and
taking cure that both he and his family were supplied with food and other
necessaries, suitable to 1113 rank: 118.-On the 3131 of Dec„ this appointment
was revoked⁸ the Vicars being too closely engaged in the Divine offiees in the
Cathedral to devote sufficient care and time to 30 arduous a business ; and
Master Henry, R. of waorthy, was appointed in their room (2 ι11111, 1317-18);
124b. He was, also, appointed (25 Few, to serve, ior the time, in the Office of
