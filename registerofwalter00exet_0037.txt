PREFACE. xxix

The Queen left England for Franco in May, 1325. And on
the 9th of September following, our Bishop, by the King's command,
accompanied Princo Edward to the French Court, to do homage to
Charles IV for the Provinces of Aquitaine and Poitou, which devard,
unwilling or unable to leave England himself, lest 110 should expose
Despcnser to the fury of the Barous, had transferred to his son.
Mortimer had joined Isahella, and Stapeldon (lid not take long to
discover what was going on, and that the abandoned wife was plotting
her husband's ruin. I-leturning to England‚—I quote, iu sulmtanee,
Dr. Oliver’s accounnvhis penetration satisfied him that everything
portended a speedy revolution. 'l'he King, at last, became sensihle
of his danger, when he heard that isabella and her paramour had
effected a landing, with a powerful force, at Orwell, on the coast of
Suffolk3 and, scal-ing· that treason had done its worst, he fied, 011 the
211d of October, with the two Desponseffi, to Bristol, and from thence
into lVales, having first issued a proelmnation from the Tower against
the rebels, and committed to the faithful Bishop the eustody of the
City of London. Stapeldon had concurr-ed with certain of the Privy
Council in promulgating· Sentence of Excommunieation against those
who had invaded the lle-alm. But the King's flight, and the successful
κάν-111100 ol' the Queen⁷s forces towards Loudon⁷ eneouraged the
citizens to break out into open rehellion against the Government.
In the French Chroniele of London (Camden society, 1844, p. 52), it
is stated that—

‘¹ The Bishop of Exeter, riding towards his Inn, er HoteL in Eldedeanes-lane,
for dinner, encountered the 111011, and, hearing them shout ‘Traitorss he rode
rapidly to St. Paul's sor sanctu-ary, but was unhoreed und taken to Cheapside,
stripe, and beheaded. William walle and John Padyngton, the Bishop's Steward,
met with the same fate. About the honr of Vespers, the same (lay, the 15th of
October, the choir ot' St. Paulus took up the headless body of the Prelate and
conveyed it to St. Paul'53 but, on being informed that he died under sentence,
the body was brought to St. element’s, beyond the Temple. but was ejected : so
that the naked corpse, with a rag given by the charity of a woman, was laid 011 a
spot called “ Le Lawles Chirche,y and. without any grave, lay there, with these of
his two EsquireS. without office of 111-10511 or clerks
