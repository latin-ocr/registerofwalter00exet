1322-3), the dispute was settled, at
Exeter, as follows z--Lord Mar-tyn aud
his heirs were to have and to hold 1118
said attachment (01 gut) for ever;
but they were bound to construet in
the said gut, by Michaelmas next
ensuing. and at their own eost, two
boxes, commonly called bracchas, to
take salmon and other fish commonly
taken, in Devon, in such boxes or
hacches ; the same to be well and
sufficiently prepared ancl closed from
above, with two locks and two keys,
and set in the fittest places for their
purpose; the said Lord Martyu and
his heire to amend, repair, and main·
tain the same in good condition‚f01·
ever, as need should 111-158. Τ118
Bishop and his Successors, without
incurring any burden or eosts them-
selves, were 10 have a moiety of all
fish caught thei-ein, or 111 the leat ot'
the mill aforesaid, 01 under the mill.
The Bishop's bailiff, deputed for this
purpose, was to hold 008 key, and
the said William's bailiff the other, in
the case of each of the boxes, so that
neither party could take any fish
without the other. As to the mill-
leat, both parties might place therein,
01 under the mill, 0015 and othei·
engines for taking fish, and wherever
they pleased so that they did not stop
the grinding3 and all fish so taken
was to be equally divided between
the parties. All the mill-men of the
said William and his heirs, in the
presence of the bailiffs of both parties,
were to be solemnly swern, on the
Holy Gospels, to commit οο fraud
against the agreement. The servants
of both parties were to have liberty
to go 011 to the land on either
side of the river and the leat, and to
stay aud return as they pleased, and
to fish in the leat aud under the
mill; but al] fish caught was to be
divided. If, iu so going, stayiug, and
returning, anydamage should be done
to the corn or to the pastore, it was

to be made good, by view 01 honest
and liege men, chosen by both parties,
without further let 01 suit. lt· such
gut, by the force of the river, 01· the
sinking of the sides, were broken or
otherwise injured, it should be lawful
for the said William and 1115 118115,
provided they keep this covenant in
every particular, to repair the same,
and even (ff necessary) to extend and
attach upon the land of the Manor of
Tawton. so as to secure a sufficient
supply of water for the said mill.
And should it happen (which God
forbid) that the said william, or his
heirs, fail to keep this covenant en-
tirely, or contravene the same, then
it should be lawful for the Bishop, or
his Successors, to demolish the said
attachment and gut as far as the
thread os the river Taw, and to carry
away the timber and other materials
thereos, appropriating them to his
own use, or disposing of them accord-
ingto pleasure. And it was never
to be re-constructed against the will
of the said Bishop, or 1115 Successore.
The witnesses were John de Carew,
Richard de Mei-tone, Nicholas de
Boneville. Richard de Stapeldone,
Robert de Stokhaye, William Here· '
ward, Roger le Jeu, Knights, and
others. Dated at Exeter, and sealed
by the Bishop, Lord Martyn, and the
Dean and Chapter. Dr. Oliver copied
this Deed in 1358,at Tawstock House,
and printed a translation of it in an
Exeter newspaper. The above is a
full abstract of the same.
