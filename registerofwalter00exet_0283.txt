PELYNT [Plenynt‚ MSJ, Rectors and Vicars of—

[The Records of Newenham Abbey shew that

Rolmrt Everaml, mentioned 111 Vol. Ι, p. 162, was presented to the Rectory of
Pelynt, by Abbat Geoffrey, in 1254. Itesigning almost immediately 116 was
granted the Peneion there referred to, the amount of which was 505. annually.
His successor was

Walter de Tremow, who was inst, 28 Oct, in the same year. This Walter had
been collated, before 1272, to a Prebend 111 (ilasney (see Vol. 1.‚ p. 96); but his
Institution thereto is not recorded. The l'cnsiou was couserred on

Niclzolas tle Musele. 19 Oct, 1275 (see V‹›1. L, 1¹- 162). He appears to have
succeeded Tremom· as Rect0r; and 116 was the last.

Rz'clzard cle Sancto 6010110 was the first l'icw· (sva Vol. 1., p. 350). His successor,

Willz'am [Ie Cadccole, was presented by Abbat Ralph, and, therefore, not earlier
than 1304. He resigned and retired 10 Newenhmn, where 116 died in 1323 and
was buried in the Cemetery there, leaving a nioicty os 1115 property to the Abbey.
The year of his death corresponds with that of the Institution of Walter Pen3
but this is merely a coincidence, for tho Newcnhani MS. shews that

Ralph [Ze Sydemoualze succeeded him, on the presentation of the same Abbat (and,
therefore, probably, between 1304 and 1:308, as he is not mentioned iu
Bp. Stapeldon's Register). He is referred to by the Ncwenham scribe, in no
flatteriug terms, ns ‘¹' Cornubicus, qui malum fecit Domui ; de quibus, posteri,
caveatis.'’ The “quibus,'' of course, is intended for Cornishinen generally,
against whom there seems to have been a strong prejudice in the Abbey; for a
similar memorandum is attached to the name ot' a subsequent Vicar, John
ιΙοξ610111,-“(10111111116116, de qna Naclmza caveant posteri; quia miser fuit et
mala Domni fecit.”-See Davidson's Ilistmy eff Ncwenham Abhey]
